INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

This is an awesome little program, Stuart, and the game
play is just about perfect. It's a bit long as I look at it
in the terminal--it takes me 3 screens to scroll through 
it all, which is longer than most programs should be, but
as I'm looking at it, if flows just as it should. Maybe
off-loading the instructions to a separate static function
would make it look more manageable. 

There is one thing that you should take a look at fixing:
you didn't implement the default Y/N option as suggested
in the handout for this assignment. By providing a default
response that will be accepted when the user just hits
the [Enter] key, the flow of the game can be improved 
even more. There's information on how to do that in the
handout, and you should definitely consider incorporating
that feature into future assignments where appropriate.

Overall, *very* nice work. Keep it up!
